This project implements a simple AI chatbot using the NLTK library for Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot recognizes user input patterns (greetings, goodbyes, thanks, and name inquiries) and provides appropriate responses. User input is preprocessed to ensure consistent matching. The chatbot runs in a loop, allowing interaction until "exit" is typed.
